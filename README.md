jANN is a artificial neural network library built mainly for didactic purposes. 
It's heavily commented to make all the functions as clear as possible. Code is adapted from David Miller's C++ neural network tutorial into Python. 

My main purpose was to better understand ANNs by implementing my own, but I am hoping that this code will help others out there. The code is licensed under LGPL v3.

Python Dependencies:
networkx
matplotlib
